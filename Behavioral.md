# Q. How do you handle a challenge? Tell me about a situation where you faced a challenge. 
## STAR method 
## S - Situation 
During my final year project, we were tasked with creating a Question Paper Generator using AI. Our goal was to ensure it could generate accurate, relevant questions based on syllabus notes. Midway, we realized the ML model wasn’t producing the expected outputs.
## T - Task
As the lead developer, my role was to identify the problem, implement a solution, and ensure the project met our deadlines
## A - Action
I first debugged the model and realized that the model I was using is not efficient for result so I modified the prompt and used google langcghain.
## R - Result
As a result, the system began generating relevant questions with 95% accuracy, and we completed the project on time. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability and thorough testing in overcoming technical challenges.

# Q. Can you work effectively under pressure? If yes, how?

Yes, I can work effectively under pressure. I see it as an opportunity to prioritize tasks, focus on solutions, and achieve results.

When faced with pressure, I stay calm and organized. I prioritize tasks based on urgency, delegate when possible, and focus on one problem at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

"During my college project, we had just two days left before the submission deadline, and one of my teammates was unavailable because they had an important interview. This left me responsible for completing the project on my own. The project was a web application, and several features were incomplete, while the existing codebase needed debugging."

"I quickly analyzed the situation, prioritized the tasks that were crucial for the project’s functionality, and created a schedule to manage my time effectively. I worked through debugging the code, implemented the missing features, and tested the application thoroughly to ensure it met the required standards. Despite the tight deadline, I stayed calm and focused, working late into the night to complete everything on time."

"In the end, I successfully submitted the project before the deadline, and it received excellent feedback from my professor. This experience taught me how to manage time effectively, adapt to unexpected challenges, and stay productive under pressure."

This experience taught me the importance of time management, adaptability, and staying calm in stressful situations. Now, I approach high-pressure situations with more confidence and clarity."

# Q. When was the last time you made a mistake and how did you handle it?

Focus on demonstrating self-awareness, accountability, and how you learned from the mistake. Avoid choosing a mistake that reflects poorly on your core competencies for the job. 

I set goals by first understanding the big picture and breaking it down into smaller, actionable steps. I ensure that each goal is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). I also regularly evaluate my progress and make adjustments as needed."

# Q. Tell me a decision that other team members or colleagues didn’t like. How did you implement it?

Situation:
"During a group project in college, we were developing a web application, and my role was to lead the design and implementation. Midway through the project, I realized that the UI design proposed by the team was too complex for the timeline we had and would take longer to implement."

Task:
"I had to decide to simplify the design, which I knew would disappoint some team members who had invested time creating the original concept. However, I was responsible for ensuring we completed the project on time without compromising core functionality."

Action:
"I called a team meeting to explain my reasoning. I acknowledged their effort and creativity but presented a timeline showing how the existing design could delay the project. I then proposed a simpler design that retained the essential elements while being more feasible within our timeframe. To address their concerns, I invited feedback and incorporated their suggestions into the simplified version to ensure they still felt involved."

Result:
"Although there was initial hesitation, the team eventually agreed. We implemented the simplified design and delivered the project on time, receiving positive feedback from our professor for balancing functionality and aesthetics. This experience taught me the importance of clear communication, being open to feedback, and balancing creativity with practicality."

# Q. Are you someone who works in a team or like solo working? Give an example of how you worked on a team.

I enjoy solo working because it allows me to focus deeply, take ownership of tasks, and showcase my individual creativity and skills. However, I also recognize the value of teamwork, such as sharing ideas, collaborating to solve problems, and achieving goals collectively. I adapt well to both environments depending on the project’s needs.

While I thrive in solo work due to my focus and independence, I also value the diverse perspectives and synergy that come from teamwork. Ultimately, I believe both approaches are essential for success, and I am comfortable switching between them as the situation demands.

During my final year project, which involved developing a Question Paper Generator, I worked with a team of peers. While I was primarily responsible for building the web application's backend and integrating AI tools, we collaborated closely to align our individual contributions with the project’s overall vision. For instance, I had to work closely with the team member handling the frontend design to ensure seamless integration and consistent functionality.

# Q. What do you do when your opinions collide with someone else?

When my opinions collide with someone else’s, I see it as an opportunity to understand their perspective and find common ground. I believe healthy discussions can lead to better decisions and outcomes, so I approach such situations with an open mind and a willingness to collaborate.

By focusing on collaboration and mutual respect, we avoided unnecessary conflict and achieved a better result. This experience taught me the importance of open communication, patience, and flexibility when dealing with differing opinions.
